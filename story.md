Once upon a time, there was a panda named sénior, who lived on bamboo farm. 
Every day, he climbed up the hill to gather all the bamboo he grew. 
Sénor panda always said, "Life will always seem hard but the truth is, it is hard. But it's about how you handle it. Live the life you know you won't regret"
